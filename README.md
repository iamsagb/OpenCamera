OpenCamera is an open-source Camera SDK designed to simplify camera integration in any Swift project. With a flexible and modular approach, OpenCamera allows you to easily customize the camera to fit your needsâ€”just like building with LEGO bricks.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Quickly add camera functionality to your Swift project.
- **Highly Customizable**: Configure options such as file format, media type (video or image), resolution, and more.
- **Modular Design**: Choose only the components you need for your project.
- **Swift Package Manager Support**: Seamlessly add OpenCamera to your project via Swift Package Manager.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add OpenCamera to your project using Swift Package Manager:

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Go to `File` > `Add Packages`.
3. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/iamsagb/OpenCamera`.
4. Select the version and add the package to your project.

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use OpenCamera:

```swift
import OpenCamera

// Create a CameraContext with your desired settings
let cameraContext = CameraContext(
    mediaType: .video, // or .image
    resolution: .hd1080,
    fileFormat: .mp4 // or .jpeg, .png, etc.
)

// Initialize and start the camera
let camera = OpenCamera(context: cameraContext)
camera.start { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let mediaURL):
        print("Media saved at: \(mediaURL)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Camera error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Customization

OpenCamera's modular design allows you to easily swap out or extend components. Customize the camera settings to match your application's requirements. Here are a few examples:

- **File Format**: Choose between JPEG, PNG, MP4, and more.
- **Media Type**: Capture either video or images.
- **Resolution**: Select from a variety of resolutions like 720p, 1080p, etc.
